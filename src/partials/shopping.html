          David Burroughs was once a devoted father to his three-year-old son
          Matthew, living a dream life just a short drive away from the
          working-class suburb where he and his wife, Cheryl, first fell in
          love--until one fateful night when David woke suddenly to discover
          Matthew had been murdered while David was asleep just down the hall.
